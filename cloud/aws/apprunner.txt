VPC needs both public and private subnets configured in order to properly use a NAT Gateway. Public subnets are subnets that have a route to the Internet Gateway. Private subnets are subnets that have a route to the NAT Gateway.
The NAT Gateway itself must reside in a public subnet.
The App Runner application must be configured to run only in private subnets.
